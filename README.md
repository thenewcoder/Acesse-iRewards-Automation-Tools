# Acesse-iRewards-Automation-Tools
Some tools for automating the boring and useless task of the Acesse iRewards Program

I had a co-worker a few years ago, that had the unforatunate task of dealing with
the Acesse iRewards Program. That unfortunate individial had to go through
several accounts every single day, easily taking a whole afternoon. It was just so
painful to watch that I felt I had to do something. So I created two automated
tools that cut down the time to just an hour or less.

(Note: The said individual no longer deals with this, so I don't know if the
tools still work or not!)

### AutoSearchTool
This tool logs in to an Acesse account and then goes through the otherwise
painstaking task of doing a web search on their Acesse search engine. The
tool is command line based.
(Note: The Acesse search engine seems to have been removed, although I might
be wrong. So this tool probbaly isn't working anymore.)

### AdViewAutoTool
This tool will open a web browser and then start going through the task of
rating websites. While this tool is supposed to be automated, it's almost
that. I never got around to deal with the captchas. Besides manually
entering captchas every 5 ratings, everything else is automated.
(Note: As far as I am aware, this task is still available at Acesse.)

### Requirements
- Python 2.x
- PIL Library (for reading captchas in AutoSearchTool)
- Tesseract OCR Engine (to read the captcha result)
- Selenium WebDriver (for AdViewAutoTool to open web browser)
